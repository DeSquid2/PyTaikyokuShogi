Taikyoku Shogi is an extremely complex chess-like board game with a large board and a huge number of pieces. While it's possible to create a fully functional Taikyoku Shogi game in Python, it would require a lot of time and effort, and is beyond the scope of a single answer.

However, I can provide you with an outline of how you can get started with creating a Taikyoku Shogi game in Python.

Create a board representation: Taikyoku Shogi has a board that is 36x36 with a total of 402 pieces. You'll need to represent the board using a data structure such as a 2D list or a dictionary. Each cell on the board will need to contain information about what piece (if any) is on it.

Define the pieces: Taikyoku Shogi has a wide variety of pieces, with each player having 201 pieces of their own. You'll need to define the various pieces and their movements in your code. You may want to create a separate class for each piece, with methods for calculating legal moves.

Implement the game rules: Taikyoku Shogi has many complex rules, such as the promotion and demotion of pieces, the use of captured pieces, and the special abilities of certain pieces. You'll need to carefully read the rules of the game and implement them in your code.

Create a user interface: You'll need to create a graphical user interface to display the game board and allow players to make moves. You can use a Python library like Pygame or Tkinter to create your interface.

Implement game logic: Finally, you'll need to implement the actual game logic, handling things like turn order, checking for legal moves, and determining when the game is over.

Keep in mind that creating a full Taikyoku Shogi game is a challenging task that will require a lot of time and effort. However, with careful planning and implementation, you can create a fully functional game that can be enjoyed by players around the world.
